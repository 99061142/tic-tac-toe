# Tic-tac-toe

First game i tried to make with python.

## How do you play the game?

You choose 'x' or 'o'. (There is no AI implemented so you must play it with 2 people.)  
Then you must choose a position to put your symbol, the position must be empty otherwise it won't work.  
At the end of the game the player who won gets shown on the screen or 'nobody won'.
